I have downloaded the tree.exe inside the zip file from here http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tree.htm as suggested.

Then I have extracted the tree.exe file to C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin (I have added this folder to windows path to make it work with the regular CMD but it works with GITBash too).

Generate index cmd:

tree -H '.' -L 1 --noreport --charset utf-8 > index.html
